**About Me**  
I am a dedicated researcher with a strong academic background in mathematics, statistics, and computer science. I currently work as a Research Assistant at the Interdisciplinary Center for Scientific Computing (IWR), Heidelberg University. My research focuses on applying mathematical frameworks to advance machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence (AI) applications. With extensive experience in Python programming, data analysis, and backend development, I thrive on solving complex problems and driving innovation.

**Interests**  
My primary interests lie in the intersection of mathematics and AI, particularly in applying machine learning and deep learning techniques to address real-world challenges. I am passionate about exploring innovative AI models, enhancing predictive analytics, and working on interdisciplinary projects that integrate computing, data science, and mathematics. Beyond research, I enjoy contributing to knowledge-sharing initiatives and mentoring others in developing their skills in AI and data science.
