We are excited to announce the establishment of our BMBF-funded Independent Research Group in the field of Artificial Intelligence at Heidelberg University, Germany. With a generous funding of approximately â‚¬1.31 million from the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), our team comprises one Postdoc, two PhD candidates, and a student assistant, in addition to my own position. The project, titled "Operator-Based Training of Recurrent Neural Networks for Time Series Analysis and Modeling of Complex Dynamical Systems," aims to develop innovative approaches to train Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for analyzing and modeling complex, real-world dynamical systems. Our interdisciplinary research focuses on leveraging AI to address challenges in time series analysis, pushing the boundaries of machine learning applications in this field. Stay tuned for updates as we progress on this exciting journey!
